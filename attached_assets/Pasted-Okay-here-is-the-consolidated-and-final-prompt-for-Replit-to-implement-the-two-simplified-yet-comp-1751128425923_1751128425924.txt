Okay, here is the consolidated and final prompt for Replit to implement the two simplified, yet comprehensive, contact forms on your landing page.

This prompt combines all the fields and instructions we've discussed.

Replit Prompt: Consolidated & Simplified Contact Forms for India Front Magazine

"Please update the index.html file to replace any existing contact forms with two new, consolidated, and user-friendly contact forms within the 'Join India's Growth Story' section. Each form should route submissions to a specific email address via Formspree.io endpoints.

1. Form for 'Guest Articles and Press Release':
* Placement: This form should be clearly visible under a new <h3> heading titled <h3>For Guest Articles & Press Releases</h3> within the 'Join India’s Growth Story' section.
* Recipient Email (via Formspree): editor@indiafront.co.in (The action attribute will use the placeholder YOUR_EDITORIAL_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT).
* Input Fields (with name attributes and label tags):
* Your Name (text input, name="name", required)
* Your Email (email input, name="email", required)
* Your Contact Number (text input, name="phone", optional)
* Your Company (text input, name="company", optional)
* Your Industry (text input, name="industry", optional) - This must be a standard text input field for free typing.
* Your Message (textarea, name="message", required, with placeholder text: 'Briefly describe your guest article idea, press release details, or general editorial inquiry.')
* Hidden Subject Field: Include a hidden input field: <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="Guest Article / Press Release Inquiry">.
* Form Attributes: Assign the id="guestArticleForm" to this form.
* Submit Button: Text should be 'Send Inquiry'.
* Message Area: A p tag with id="guestArticleFormMessage" should be placed below the form for success/error feedback.

2. Form for 'Advertising & Brand Partnership Opportunities':
* Placement: This form should be clearly visible under a new <h3> heading titled <h3>For Advertising & Brand Partnerships</h3> within the 'Join India’s Growth Story' section.
* Recipient Email (via Formspree): sales@indiafront.co.in (The action attribute will use the placeholder YOUR_BRAND_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT).
* Input Fields (with name attributes and label tags):
* Your Name (text input, name="name", required)
* Your Company (text input, name="company", optional)
* Your Email (email input, name="email", required)
* Your Contact Number (text input, name="phone", optional)
* Your Industry (text input, name="industry", optional) - This must be a standard text input field for free typing.
* Your Message (textarea, name="message", required, with placeholder text: 'Briefly describe your advertising needs, brand, and partnership interests.')
* Hidden Subject Field: Include a hidden input field: <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="Advertising / Brand Partnership Inquiry">.
* Form Attributes: Assign the id="brandPartnershipForm" to this form.
* Submit Button: Text should be 'Send Inquiry'.
* Message Area: A p tag with id="brandPartnershipFormMessage" should be placed below the form for success/error feedback.

Common Form Elements (for both forms):

Spam Prevention: Include a hidden _gotcha input field within each form: <input type="text" name="_gotcha" style="display:none;" />.

Structure: Each form and its fields should be enclosed in appropriate div containers to facilitate styling (e.g., div class="form-group" for each label/input pair).

JavaScript Integration:

Update Existing Script: Modify the existing JavaScript block (typically found near the closing </body> tag) to correctly handle submissions for both the guestArticleForm and brandPartnershipForm IDs.

Event Listeners: Add addEventListener('submit', async (event) => { ... }); for both form IDs.

Feedback Display: Ensure that formMessage updates correctly for each form using their respective message area IDs (e.g., document.getElementById('guestArticleFormMessage')).

Form Reset: Ensure form.reset() is called on successful submission for the specific form.

Layout and Styling:

CSS Integration: Provide basic, clean CSS within a <style> block (or suggest adding to your style.css) for form elements (inputs, textareas, labels, buttons) to ensure they are visually appealing, well-spaced, and responsive. The goal is a simplified, modern look that matches the rest of the landing page.

Responsiveness: Ensure forms are fully responsive across different screen sizes.
