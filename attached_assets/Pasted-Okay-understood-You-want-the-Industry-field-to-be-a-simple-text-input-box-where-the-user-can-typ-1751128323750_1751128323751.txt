Okay, understood. You want the "Industry" field to be a simple text input box where the user can type in their industry, rather than a dropdown or pre-defined list.

Here's the revised prompt for Replit, confirming the "Industry" field as a text input box for both forms:

Replit Prompt (Consolidated Forms with Industry & Company Fields - Industry as Text Box):

Common Form Elements for Both Forms:

Both forms should include a hidden _gotcha input field for basic spam prevention (name="_gotcha", style="display:none;").

Add basic label elements for each input field.

Ensure both forms are within div containers that allow for appropriate styling.

Update JavaScript Handling:

Confirm the existing JavaScript correctly handles submissions for both guestArticleForm and brandPartnershipForm IDs, ensuring success/error messages are displayed correctly.

Layout and Styling:

Ensure the forms are well-spaced and visually appealing within the 'Join Indiaâ€™s Growth Story' section. Adjust any relevant CSS to accommodate the new fields and maintain a clean, user-friendly appearance.
